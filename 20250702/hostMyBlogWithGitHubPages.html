<h1 id="my-blog">My Blog</h1>
<p>Managing articles through linked is quite cumbersome, and even if
it's better than posts, I still find them quickly lost in the noise of
LinkedIn, not really simple to access for management.</p>
<p>So I have decided to build <strong>my own blog</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn’t wanted a complex solution that I’d have to heavily maintain,
therefore I decided to use GitHub Pages to publish my articles.</p>
<p>In order to easily and efficiently publish those articles, I’m using
GitHub Actions to build this simple static web page.</p>
<p>The workflow is quite simple yet efficient.</p>
<p>I’m writing my articles in <strong>LibreOffice
<strong>writer</strong></strong>, which I save as ODT format.</p>
<p>Once my article is complete, I commit it and push it to my GitHub
repository.</p>
<p>This triggers a GitHub Action which converts the ODT files to HTML,
then updates <em>index.html</em> to add all the articles.</p>
<p>The blog ( Index.html ) is simple rebuilt at each push to my
repository.</p>
<h2 id="heres-my-workflow-in-detail">Here’s my workflow in detail:</h2>
<p>I couldn’t resist creating a Rust tool to enable more automation.</p>
<h3 id="step-1"><strong>Step 1:</strong></h3>
<p>With my Rust tool, I create the architecture and a template ODT
file.</p>
<p>It:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializes a folder with the date of the first Wednesday of the
following month.</li>
<li>Asks for a file name.</li>
<li>Opens <strong>LibreOffice</strong> with the new ODT file.</li>
</ul>
<p>https://github.com/Vagrantin/odt-cli-creator</p>
<h3 id="step-2"><strong>Step 2:</strong></h3>
<p>I’m writing my article in <strong>LibreOffice
<strong>Writer.</strong></strong></p>
<h3 id="step-3"><strong>Step 3:</strong></h3>
<p>Once I’m happy with the article, saves it as LibreOffice standard
format “odt” file, then commit everything and push it to my
repository.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-github-action"><strong>Step 4: GitHub
Action</strong></h3>
<p>Once pushed to main:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Action checks out the repository.</li>
<li>Downloads and installs <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</li>
<li>Triggers a script to build the blog.</li>
<li>Commits and pushes back to publish the rebuilt HTML files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-script-to-build-the-blog">The script to build the blog:</h2>
<ul>
<li>First step: delete all existing HTML files (they are going to be
rebuilt afterwards).</li>
<li>The index HTML main page is then recreated using
<strong>Pandoc</strong>, adding all articles one by one by their
publication date.</li>
<li>Each folder is dated with its publication date. I’m just converting
the folder’s name into a nicer format for the blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then another GitHub Action is triggered a few minutes later to deploy
the repository for <strong>Github Pages</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s it — simple and easy to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps:</h2>
<p>I will improve the design and the conversion to make the articles
easier fun to read. Will probably add some titles along side the date as
well. Once I understand how it works link it to a dedicated domain
name.</p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy reading them.</p>
<p>My blog is accessible here:</p>

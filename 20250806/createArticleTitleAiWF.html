<h1 id="my-auto-titles-part-1">My auto titles – Part 1</h1>
<p>Now that I have setup a my workflow to publish to Github page my
blog.</p>
<p>I wanted to improve it a bit by adding titles to each blog post.</p>
<p>For this, as this is a trend in my recent learning journey, I have
decided to use LLM to create titles automatically.</p>
<p>On top of that to be an learning experience, I have build a workflow
using local AI to automatically generate the blog posts titles each time
I’m rebuilding the my blog.</p>
<p>Since I fully rebuild my blog every month when I publish a new post.
We will have new titles every month :D</p>
<p>In this post I would like to guide through the high level of the
workflow and then next month will look at the back-end using ollama and
qwen2 0.5B Model.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-work">How does this work ?</h2>
<h3 id="ollama-integration">Ollama integration</h3>
<p>In term of infrastructure I have my local machine on which I’m doing
all my dev.</p>
<p>And I have a VM on a separate machine which is running the title
generation workflow.</p>
<p>Essentially, all my articles are written in Libre Office.</p>
<p>Once, I’m fine with my article, I have a script which push all the
odt files to a watch-folder on my VM.</p>
<p>Then, I remote execute on my VM a python script which, with Ollama
automatically triggering the title generation. For each odt file a text
file with the same file-name is created and contains the article
title.</p>
<p>I import back all those text files to my local machine.</p>

style="width:6.9252in;height:2.9382in" /></p>
<h3 id="blog-building">Blog building</h3>
<p>I have then updated my bash script responsible for re-building the
HTML page each time I’m committing to my GitHub repo.</p>
<p>In this build step, I’m now comparing the filename of the odt and the
filename of the txt. </p>
<p>When they match, I’m reading the content of the txt file using the
“head”. </p>
<p>And append the title to publication date.</p>
<p>Here is how this part of the code looks:</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000005DD0000021FD0E28905CFBBBC7C.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:2.5047in" /></p>
<h2 id="every-month-new-titles">Every month new titles !</h2>
<p>I have tested several models and end up selecting for now qwen2 0.5B
model. The titles are a bit weird but it has the merit to be quite fast
to run on CPU, I’m not using GPU for inference for now. Gemma3n is very
good but much slower to run.</p>
<p>Will probably change the model time to time and improve this workflow
in the future.</p>
<p>I find it funny to have a new title every month for every article.
And with this workflow this is quite straight forward to automatically
create those titles.</p>
<p>This had a very good advantage to get me up to speed on playing with
ollama and offline LLM, I have so much more workflow I would like to put
it place this is going to be exciting !</p>
<p>Can’t wait to tell you about it !</p>
<p>Next time we will go through the back-end which is the title workflow
creation, hope you will enjoy the read.</p>
<p>If you want to have a look at the code as usual.</p>

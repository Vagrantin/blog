<h1 id="the-head-on-the-read-block">The head on the read block</h1>
<p>I have not finished to put everything together also I’m getting
there.</p>
<p>Here is the current status of the “cargo test” output, which is
testing my code against the expected output provided.</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000004190000019C3CC0D22BDFF8C067.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:2.7193in" /></p>
<p>In a nutshell some of the failed test will need more investigations
to be fixed since the are related how characters and strings are
interpreted in Rust. This potentially will require a redesign of my
program.</p>
<p>One failure is more personal interpretation of the expected output,
this is the “skips_bad_file”</p>
<p>Concretely this is the expected output by the tests cases:</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000002CB0000006F19D84F6489BCED58.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:1.0752in" /></p>
<p>This is the output of my version of head</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000002720000004601780FA891A2A425.png"
style="width:6.5193in;height:0.7283in" /></p>
<p>And this is the output of the GNU coreutils head version</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000004AE0000008382393BF98B07E164.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:0.7563in" /></p>
<p>Also, I don’t understand the expected output by the test cases, for
the sake of getting 100% pass of the test, I will fix my code to match
the expected output.</p>
<p>And I will probably write a new test that match GNU Coreutils head
version.</p>
<p>This shows one of the limit of TDD model regarding development, I
have the feeling this is good for University, PhD or white paper but not
yet convinced this is very efficient to apply in a production pipeline.
I think tests should be written along the way to meet the expectation of
the production and not only the expectation of the developer which
doesn’t have the same perspective, I’m digressing and that’s another
topic on it’s own that I may address in 20 years when I have more
experience on the subject.</p>
<h1 id="back-to-our-investigation">Back to our investigation</h1>
<p>From the failed test above, let’s start from the bottom, related to
the “three” tests,</p>
<p>This is going to be an interesting investigation because most of the
tests failed for “three”. This file being part of the “multiple_files”
test case once this is fixed I should have a good proportion of my
remaining failing tests to pass.</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/1000000000000172000000F6261356188F999449.png"
style="width:3.8535in;height:2.5618in" /></p>
<p>Let’s look at this case through “multiple_files” failed test</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000003F500000183FA2E644017ED1BF6.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:2.6453in" /></p>
<p>This is the output of my version of head</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000006030000020CC9ACC1C606F5C988.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:2.3575in" /></p>
<p>This this the output of GNU coreutils head.</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000005680000020B839A6164216D8951.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:2.6161in" /></p>
<p>Running both in a bash shell, visually I don’t see any differences
but the “cargo test” is failing.</p>
<p>Obviously, I have an issue where the output is not strictly the
same.</p>
<p>Doing a diff of both output is effectively reporting a difference on
lines 11 and 12, even if it is not visually reported in my bash
output.</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000001AE0000008F00B7F54216DC6942.png"
style="width:4.4783in;height:1.4898in" /></p>
<p>Line count of each version of both output </p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000001AF00000055665C8B501DA82B0B.png"
style="width:4.489in;height:0.8846in" /></p>
<p>I did a test where I’m converting to hexadecimal both output, I do
see differences but this time at different place of the files 11 and 19,
which doesn’t match the diff above which is on line 11 and 12</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000002EC000001AD72C1A2983A245253.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:3.9717in" /></p>
<p>Line count of each hexadecimal version of both output </p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000001E10000005B79EC623040311691.png"
style="width:5.0098in;height:0.948in" /></p>
<p>The Hexadecimal output is not really interesting in this case, and
doesn't really help me because I’m not able to interpret it correctly to
understand what is my issue.</p>
<p>So, let’s take another path, i have opened both output in my vim
editor and show all non-printable characters. </p>
<p>This is the output of my rust version of head</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000001A900000203BA96E04ED8CA5A8D.png"
style="width:4.4264in;height:5.3638in" /></p>
<p>This is the version of GNU coreutils head</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000001970000020519708EF13C84FA03.png"
style="width:4.239in;height:5.3846in" /></p>
<p>Interesting to see that we have a character “^M” at the end of two
lines that I don’t have in my output.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the original source file on which I’m running
both “head”</p>
<p>Tada !</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/100000000000018F00000077F0099C5D96CD15F4.png"
style="width:4.1555in;height:1.2398in" /></p>
<p>Doing googling ( old school :D ) this character “^M” is the way for
vim to represent the Windows newline character which is a combination of
two characters “0xD 0xA”, where in UNIX the new line character is
“0xA”.</p>
<p>So this means this file has been edited at some point on a Windows
machine.</p>
<p>And the GNU Coreutils head version is keeping it in the output where
my Rust version doesn’t.</p>
<p>At first I would consider this is better to strip out this
unnecessary character, but one can argue that doing so I’m altering the
original file which could have been built this way intentionally.</p>
<p>This is quite a specific use case, also I’m interested to see if I
can manage to comply to the GNU coreutils head version and pass around
all the characters.</p>
<p>This is for the next round.</p>
<p>See you there !</p>
<p>With kind regards</p>

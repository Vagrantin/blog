<p>My head is done !</p>
<p>I finally made it, a cut down version of GNU head</p>
<p>This was fun, a bit of headache some times…</p>
<p>Since this training book has been built in TDD ( Test driven
development ) way I had to do some back and for between the expected
result and what result I had.</p>
<p>So this was not at all programming issues but purely achieving what
the tests case where expecting.</p>
<p>And for couple of use case I have even changed the test scenario to
match my output :D</p>
<p>I know this sounds crazy but I would like to show you the both case
where I did so.</p>
<p>Let’s first have a look at a diff between the two tests script, the
original one and mine.</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/100000000000070E000001484212000633DE2178.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:1.2571in" /></p>
<p>I have colored all 3 differences for ease of read.</p>
<p>The first one this is purely cosmetic and for my personal convenience
I have a different project name and consequently different binary
name.</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> Case:</p>
<p>In this case we are testing the program to make sure it reports an
error if we use both parameters “-n” and “-c” at the same time which is
not supported.</p>
<p>We are using clap v2 branch ( exactly v2.34 ) to build this cli
tool.</p>
<p>Also, with clap to manage the incompatibility between two parameters
there is a dedicated method for that which is <a
href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.34.0/clap/struct.ArgGroup.html#method.conflicts_with">conflict_with</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I know, this method provide it’s dedicated and builtin
output, you probably see where I’m going with it.</p>
<p>The output of the clap create that I’m using is not the same as the
one expected by the test case.</p>
<p>This is the output expected by the test case:</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000002520000011962F86465BAFD1046.png"
style="width:6.1866in;height:2.9264in" /></p>
<p>This is the output of my program:</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/100000000000033400000094152FA9FE89D9CF35.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:1.25in" /></p>
<p>So unless, I rewrite clap to change the output behavior in this
condition, which was clearly not an option for me, I decided to modify
the expected output of the test case to match mine since it is perfectly
reasonable and as expected.</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Case:</p>
<p>In this case found the expected result a bit weird for me, even more
it is expected a totally different behavior than GNU head.</p>
<p>In this test case, the goal is to skip bad files / files that don’t
exist and through an error message for those files.</p>
<p>This is the original tests scenario</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/100000000000025B0000010F5801355EE89FF4A1.png"
style="width:6.2807in;height:2.822in" /></p>
<p>This is my version:</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/100000000000025700000108D1D81EF22687C8D8.png"
style="width:6.239in;height:2.7492in" /></p>
<p>Let me show you the different output.</p>
<p>This is the output of my head:</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/100000000000041100000083915605ABA4D4B1AA.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:0.8709in" /></p>
<p>This the output of GNU head:</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000004EA000000853C2BB07F379F83E6.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:0.7311in" /></p>
<p>This is interesting because we have the same structure and output
expect or for the format of the error message.</p>
<p>This is where I found strange that the expected output must be the
error message only instead of matching more closely to what is output by
GNU head.</p>
<p>Consequently I consider this test to pass as soon as the expected
error message is <em><strong>contained</strong></em> in the output and
<em><strong>not is the all</strong><strong> </strong></em>output.</p>
<h1 id="fixing-bugs">Fixing bugs:</h1>
<p>In the previous article I spent some time talking about end line
characters and specially the return carrier.</p>
<p>I have manage to fix this issue by refactoring my code.</p>
<p>Effectively in the previous version I was using the <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.BufRead.html#method.lines">lines()</a>
method which is consuming the return carrier or line return when
iterating on each lines.</p>
<p>Consequently I have moved to the <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.BufRead.html#method.read_line">read_line()</a>
method which is outputting everything including the return carrier or
line return that are in the string.</p>
<p>At the same time, I have discovered the <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.loop.html">loop{}</a>
keyword which is very useful to do very simple loop then break out on
specified condition.</p>
<p>This what looks like the piece of code now using read_line(), this is
a much concise code, I have to appreciate that !</p>

Cuisine with Ratatui.rs</h1>
<p>I’m always looking for solutions to improve my personal workflow, on
top of that, really dislike blotted operating system and Microsoft is
more and more a blotted operating system.</p>
<p>We are forced to upgrade hardware an very regular basis even if PCs
are becoming more and more realible.</p>
<p>My current laptop is 7 years old, and when runing Windows 10, I could
feel it suffering, hearing the fans at 100% all the time. Seeing tons of
processes eating the RAM and the CPU.</p>
<p>Once I move to PopOS with i3 windows Manager this has been a new life
for my laptop.</p>
<p>It is blazzing fast ! </p>
<p>The perspective of migrating to Windows 11 is very painfull to me,
with all those AI engine force to you on the machine will add even more
hardware requirements to be able to continue be supported by Microsoft
even with security patches ( Windows 10 support is finished on October
2025 ).</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I see AI engines as tools and I still plan to use
AI tools as you will see in this article. But I would like to choose
when to use it and control what data I’m sending over.</p>
<p>With built in AI engines in the OS, I’m very concern of the privacy
for me and my company.</p>
<p>I’m sure we will pay the price at some point, and this will be very
expensive.</p>
<p>To finish on this at some point I will probably setup my own local
LLM using open source solution.</p>
<p>Recently DeepSeek R1 is a good contenter and has reshuffled the card
on the AI landscape !</p>
<p>Ratutui.rs</p>
<p>For those would don’t know Ratatui.rs (<a
href="https://ratatui.rs/">https://ratatui.rs/</a>), I would like to do
a short introduction about it.</p>
<p>This is a Rust Library for creating Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs).
It has an API to build terminal based application, it supports realtime
updates, user interaction and it supports Linux, macOS, Windows.</p>
<p>With Ratatui you build your app using widgets ( tables, charts, list,
paragraphes, gauges), you have also blocks and borders to organize your
layout and then style it. What we will be using today is canvas to build
custom drawing on your terminal. As said above it support user
interaction with the mouse or keyboard to have an interactive UI.</p>
<p>Let’s get to the cooking.</p>
<p>As usual, since the beginning of this series of article, I have been
using a generative AI to build the original version then I have fixed
it.</p>
<p>I used claude.ai for this exercise.</p>
<p>The goal of this exercises was to get more familiar with Ratatui and
the possiblities of this library as well as continue to use Rust for the
programing language.</p>
<p>I wanted to draw in kind of “ASCII” style the text “HAPPY NEW YEAR
2025!” on the screen leveraging this library.</p>
<p>As usual the first proposition was not at all what I have
expected.</p>
<p>So, after correcting the requested it gave me somewhat what I was
expecting but </p>
<p>all letters where flipped and some words where missing!</p>
<p>I could probably asked the generative AI to fix it but this is where
I took back the control and fix it so I can have an understanding on the
way the library works and then improve it because it was messing some
words, looks like generative AI are getting lazy…</p>
<p>And with this I end up with almost what I wanted, need to investigate
more how I can improve the styling but overall I’m pretty happy of the
result and this gives way too much ideas of what can be done with this
library.</p>

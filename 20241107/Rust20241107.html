<h1 id="lia-est-dans-la-place-is-this-about-coding">L’IA est dans la
place, is this about coding ?</h1>
<p>So for this one I have heavily used AI and took the opportunity to
test Claude AI ( <a href="https://claude.ai/">https://claude.ai</a>
)</p>
<p>For accuracy I’ve been using Sonnet 3.5.</p>
<p>This seems to be the new hype right now with a better / more accurate
result than what OpenAI can propose with ChatGPT or Microsoft with
Copilot ( also I think this is mainly OpenAI behind Copilot ).</p>
<p>Building Word Count cli tool </p>
<p>https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/wc-invocation.html</p>
<p>One thing I found very interesting is that Claude AI proposed me two
solutions.</p>
<p>Here was my prompt:</p>
<p>“in Rust how can I count the number of words from a text file ?”</p>
<p>And here was the two solution proposed:</p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000002E2000002B81A757E3554233F53.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:6.5307in" /></p>
<p><img src="./Pictures/10000000000002BC000001CDE2507A1FB18711E2.png"
style="width:6.9252in;height:4.5602in" /></p>
<p>What I found very interesting is that this seconde solution is very
similar to the solution propose by the author of the book “<a
href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/command-line-rust/9781098109424/">Command-Line
Rust</a>”</p>
<p>You can check it out on his <a
href="https://github.com/kyclark/command-line-rust/tree/clap_v2/05_wcr">git
repo</a> dedicated for this book</p>

<p>This is where it comes the interesting question, what will be the
value of all those AI models when the have trained on all human produced
data on Github ? They will probably move to Gitlab at some point :D (
spoiler they already have )</p>
<p>But think we will reach a limit seeing the pace at which they are
eating data compared to the pace we are producing data on the WWW…</p>
<p>Or maybe the limit will be how fast we are able to build nuclear
plant around the world ?</p>
<p>Anyway I think you have to be in the AI world to be able to see what
will be the limit of this new set of tools.</p>
<p>I believe that the AI model will at some point specialize and never
will be very good on general matters and we will see a proliferation of
specialized models.</p>
<p>Back to my Rust</p>
<p>On this exercise, I tried to see if using AI engine on my learning
path is beneficial to learn a new language. To be honest I’m still half
way convinced.</p>
<p>The merit is that I could quickly unlock myself in building my tool,
then from the code provided by the AI engine build on top of it.</p>
<p>The cons is that I’m afraid this a too easy way and doesn’t give me
the skill set to find solution by myself with trial and error. Being so
easy give me the impression that we are going to have brain lazyness and
stop us from thinking and building stuff on our own.</p>
<p>I have the sentiment of loosing control over what I’m building, when
I give away this skill to an AI engine which will make me over dependent
on this tool.</p>
<p>So for the future I think I will be in and out to see if it helps me
but I don’t chain me. </p>
<p>I can’t be this AI addict which will not be able to do anything
without it.</p>
<p>Does AI improved your productivity ? Do you see it a net benefice for
your and your company ?</p>

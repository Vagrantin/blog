<h1 id="why-im-falling-in-love-with-rust">Why I'm Falling in Love with
Rust</h1>
<p>Hey there! Let me tell you why I'm so excited about learning Rust.
It's not just another programming language; it's a game-changer for me.
Here's why:</p>
<h2 id="why-i-like-rust">Why I Like Rust</h2>
<h3 id="memory-safety">Memory Safety</h3>
<p>First off, Rust is memory safe. This means I can write code without
worrying about common bugs like null pointer dereferences or buffer
overflows. It's like having a safety net that catches errors at compile
time, which is a huge relief.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>With Rust, I can produce more secure code. In today's world, where
security breaches are all too common, using a language that prioritizes
safety is a big win. It's reassuring to know that the code I write is
less likely to have vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Learning a Compiled Language</p>
<p>Rust is a compiled language, in the same area as C and C++. This
gives me the opportunity to dive into low-level programming while still
enjoying modern language features. It's like getting the best of both
worlds—performance and safety.</p>
<p>Why I'm Learning Rust</p>
<p>Love for Learning</p>
<p>I simply love learning new programming languages. Each language
offers a unique perspective on solving problems, and Rust is no
exception. It challenges me to think differently and grow as a developer
( Which I will never be because of at least my lack of algorthim
knowledge ).</p>
<p>Developing CLI Tools</p>
<p>One of the reasons I'm diving into Rust is to develop command-line
interface (CLI) tools. Rust's efficiency and performance make it perfect
for building fast and reliable CLI applications. I can already see
myself creating tools that make my daily tasks easier.</p>
<p>Crafting Custom Software</p>
<p>Rust provides me with the freedom to craft software tailored to my
specific needs. Whether it's a small utility or a larger project, Rust's
flexibility and power allow me to build exactly what I envision.</p>
<p>Generative AI</p>
<p>With the advent of Generative AI, the possibilities are endless. I
can now craft applications that I wouldn't have even thought few months
ago. AI tools can help me generate code snippets, debug, and even
optimize my Rust programs, making the learning process even more
exciting.</p>
<p>What Has Changed</p>
<p>The landscape of software development is evolving rapidly. With
Generative AI, I can now tackle projects that were once beyond my reach.
It's like having a superpower that amplifies my creativity and
productivity.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I hope this gives you a good sense of why I'm so passionate about
Rust. It's not just about writing code; it's about embracing a new way
of thinking and creating. If you're curious about Rust, I highly
recommend giving it a try. You might just fall in love with it too!</p>
